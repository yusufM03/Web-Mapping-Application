## Overview  
This project is a web-based mapping tool designed to provide an interactive experience for working with geospatial data. Built using **HTML**, **JavaScript**,**Bootstrap**, **OpenLayers**, it offers users features like drawing custom geometries, real-time geolocation, and a responsive interface. 

Using GeoServer, a powerful map server, this project incorporates the following functionalities:  

- **Web Publication**: Facilitates the publication of spatial data as cartographic services accessible on the web.  
- **Data Management**: Supports the loading, configuration, and publication of both vector and raster data layers.  
- **Custom Styles**: Defines publication styles for vector data using Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) standards.  
- **Web Integration**: Implements HTML and JavaScript programming to create an interactive map, utilizing jQuery, Bootstrap, and JSON for enhanced interactivity.  
- **Mapping API**: Leverages OpenLayers 6 Geolocation API for dynamic geolocation and web-based mapping functionalities.  

## Installation Steps  
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.  
2. Configure **GeoServer** for map layer management as per the setup guidelines.
